        This section allows you to test the app using a set of pre-defined commands.
        \nDuring testing, the system checks the accessibility of various websites through the proxy, and you can monitor progress in real time.
        \n
        \nNote that this testing feature is still under development, and the set of commands is currently limited.
        \nTest results may be useful for initial proxy evaluation but do not guarantee flawless operation under real-world conditions.
